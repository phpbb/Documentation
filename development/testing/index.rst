Testing
=======

To ensure code integrity as new features are added and existing features are
altered by patches, phpBB utilizes the PHPUnit test framework. This way, the
development team can keep track of whether or not a change made to the core
will effect other existing features in unforeseen ways.

There are two main types of tests that can be written and run: unit tests, and
functional tests.
