Submission guidelines
=====================

Description
-----------

Contribution description in the `Customisation Database`_
should be translated into English in addition of your local language, as some
administrators might want to download your translation without speak your
language.

Screenshot
----------

Contribution screenshot in the `Customisation Database`_ should only be the
flag of the country whose the language is spoken. For example, the flag of
France for the French language.

Demo-Link
---------

The Demo URL in the Customisation Database must be empty, unless you want to
put a link to an international community (
`officially <https://www.phpbb.com/support/intl/>`_ listed or not) related to
the language of the contribution. For example, http://www.phpbbarabia.com/ as
Demo URL concerning the
`Arabic language <https://www.phpbb.com/customise/db/translation/arabic/>`_ is
allowed.

Package
-------

  ``<languagename>_<version>`` folder. The files from above should be placed in
  this folder.
* Revision name in the `Customisation Database`_ should be left blank, contain
  the phpBB package version and/or package release name (e.g. ``3.0.12`` /
  ``Richard 'DÂ¡cky' Foote`` for 3.0.12) for more understanding.

Package Validation
==================

* Language packages must include all files that are included in the folders for
  the English language. This includes the following folders:

    + ``language/{iso}/README.md``
    + ``language/{iso}/VERSION.md``

* No other additional files are allowed!
* All folders must contain an ``index.htm`` file.

File Validation
===============

* All files must be stored using ``LF`` (LineFeed / UNIX) line endings.
* All ``.php`` files must have a check for the ``IN_PHPBB`` constant:

    .. code-block:: php

        if (!defined('IN_PHPBB'))
        {
            exit;
        }

* All files containing non-english language (``.php``, ``.txt``, as well as all
  additional files from `Package Validation`_) must be saved as *UTF8 without
  BOM*.
* ``.php`` files must **not** produce any output. There should be no characters
  before ``<?php``. ``.php`` files must **not** contain the closing tag ``?>``,
  but just end with a new line

language/{iso}/iso.txt
----------------------

* The file must contain exactly 3 lines:

    #. English language name
    #. Language name in the spoken language
    #. Author(-group) information (Plaintext only, no links allowed)

\*/index.htm
------------

The ``index.htm`` files in all folders must either be completly empty, or
contains the default html body:

.. code-block:: html

    <html>
    <head>
    <title></title>
    <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=iso-8859-1">

        array(
            0 => 'TextA',
            1 => 'TextB',
        ),

    + If TextA is ``--`` the entry is a headline.
    + If both, TextA and TextB, are ``--`` the entry causes a column switch for
      the 2 column page layout. A ``help/*.php`` file must contain exactly one
      of these entries.

* For TextA and TextB normal `Key Validation`_ applies.

Key Validation
==============

Type
----

* Entries must be of the same type as in the english language. If the entry is
  of type ``string``, your translation must be of type ``string``. If the
  english language is of type ``array`` (e.g. using plurals), your translation
  must be of type ``array`` aswell.
* If the entry is an array, your translation must contain the same keys as the
  english array. Exceptions are plural forms.

String And Integer Replacements
-------------------------------

* If the english string contains replacements, such as ``%s``, ``%1$s``, ``%d``
  and ``%1$d``, your string should contain the same number of replacements.
  Exceptions are integer replacements in plural forms. This allows you to use::

    No posts

  rather then::

    0 posts

HTML
----

* Strings should only contain HTML that is also included in the english
  strings.
* Additional ``<a href="">``, ``<strong>``, ``<em>``, ``<u>`` and ``<br />``
  are allowed.
* ``<b>`` should not be used, use ``<strong>`` instead.
* ``<i>`` should not be used, use ``<em>`` instead.
* Strings should only close HTML which it has opened itself and should close
  all HTML it has opened. Exceptions here are:

    + ``language/{iso}/install.php``
        * ``INSTALL_CONGRATS_EXPLAIN``
        * ``INSTALL_INTRO_BODY``
        * ``SUPPORT_BODY``
        * ``UPDATE_INSTALLATION_EXPLAIN``
        * ``OVERVIEW_BODY``
    + ``language/{iso}/ucp.php``
        * ``TERMS_OF_USE_CONTENT``
        * ``PRIVACY_POLICY``

  which are always inside of a ``<p>`` tag and are allowed to close it, if they
  reopen it later on.

Arrays
------

* Arrays must have the same structure and elements as the english version.
  Exceptions are plural forms, which may have more or less keys, depending on
  the plural rule.
