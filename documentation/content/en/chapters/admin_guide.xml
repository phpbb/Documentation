		<title>The Administration Control Panel</title>
		<para>Even more so than its predecessor, phpBB 3.2 &quot;Rhea&quot; is highly configurable. You can tune, adjust, or turn off almost all features. To make this load of settings as accessible as possible, we redesigned the Administration Control Panel (ACP) completely. </para>
		<para>Click on the <guilabel>Administration Control Panel</guilabel> link on the bottom of the default forum style to visit the <acronym>ACP</acronym>.</para>
		<para>The <acronym>ACP</acronym> has seven different sections by default with each containing a number of subsections. We will discuss each section in this Admin Guide. </para>

		<title>General Configuration and Front Page</title>
		<para>The <guimenuitem>General</guimenuitem> section is the first screen you see each time you log into the <acronym>ACP</acronym>. It contains some basic statistics and information about your forum. It also has a subsection called <guimenuitem>Quick Access</guimenuitem>. It provides quick access to some of the admin pages that are frequently used, like <link linkend="acp_users">User Management</link> or <link linkend="acp_maintenance">Moderator Logs</link>. We will discuss its items later in their specific sections.</para>

				<title>Board Settings</title>
				<para>The <guimenuitem>Board Settings</guimenuitem> allow you to change many settings that govern your board. These settings include important things such as the name of your forum! There are two main groups of board settings: the general <guilabel>Board Settings</guilabel>, and <guilabel>Warnings</guilabel> settings.</para>
				
				<itemizedlist>
					<title>Board Settings</title>
					<listitem><para>The very first board setting you can edit is perhaps the most important setting of them all: the name of your board. Your users identify your board with this name. Put the name of your site into the <guilabel>Site Name</guilabel> text field and it will be shown on the header of the default style; it will be the prefix to the window title of your browser.</para></listitem>
					<listitem><para>The <guilabel>Site Description</guilabel> is the slogan or tagline of your forum. It will appear below the <guilabel>Site Name</guilabel> on the default style's header.</para></listitem>
					<listitem><para>You can also use the <guilabel>Main website URL</guilabel> and <guilabel>Main website text</guilabel> fields to add a link to your home page in the breadcrumbs. The board's logo will also use this link.</para></listitem>
					<listitem><para>If you need to close your whole forum to do maintenance work, for instance, you can do it by using the <guilabel>Disable Board</guilabel> switch. To temporarily disable your board, select<guilabel>Yes</guilabel>. This will keep any members of your forum who are not administrators or moderators from accessing your board. They will either see a default message instead of the forum, or a message that you create. You can add your own custom message that will be displayed when your board is disabled in the text box below the <guilabel>Disable board</guilabel> radio buttons. Administrators and moderators will still be able to browse forums and use their specific control panels when the board is disabled.</para></listitem>
					<listitem><para>You also need to set the <guilabel>Default Language</guilabel> of your board. This is the language that guests will see when they visit your board. You can allow registered users to choose other languages. By default, the only language installed is <guilabel>English [GB]</guilabel>, but you can <ulink url="https://www.phpbb.com/languages">download more languages on the phpBB website</ulink> and install them on your board. Find out more about working with languages in the <link linkend="acp_customise_language">section on Language Pack configuration</link>.</para></listitem>
					<listitem><para>You can also configure your board's default date format. phpBB3 has a few basic date formats that you can set your board to use; if these are not sufficient and you would like to customise your board's date format, choose <guimenuitem>Custom</guimenuitem> from the <guilabel>Date format</guilabel> selection menu. Then, in the text box besides it, type in the format you would like to use. This is the same as the <ulink url="http://www.php.net/date">PHP date() function</ulink>.</para></listitem>
					<listitem><para>Along with setting your board's default date format, you can also set your board's preferred timezone. The timezones available in the <guilabel>System timezone</guilabel> selection menu are all based on relative <acronym>UTC</acronym> (for most intents and purposes, it is <acronym>GMT</acronym>, or Greenwich Mean Time) times.</para></listitem>
					<listitem><para>You can also set your board's default style. The board will appear to your guests and members in the <guilabel>Default Style</guilabel>. In the standard phpBB installation, two styles are available: prosilver and subsilver2. You can either allow users to select another style than the default by selecting <guilabel>No</guilabel> in the <guilabel>Override User Style</guilabel> setting or disallow it. Please visit the <link linkend="acp_customise_styles">styles section</link> to find out how to add new styles and where to find some.</para></listitem>
				</itemizedlist>
				
				<itemizedlist>
					<title>Warnings</title>
					<listitem><para>Moderators can send warnings to users that break the forum rules. The value of <guilabel>Warning Duration</guilabel> defines the number of days a warning is valid until it expires. All positive integers are valid values. For more about warnings, please read <xref linkend="moderator_mcp" />.</para></listitem>

				<title>Board Features</title>
				<para>Through the <guimenuitem>Board Features</guimenuitem> section, you can enable or disable several features board-wide. Note that any feature you disable here will not be available on your forum, even if you give your users permissions to use them.</para>
				<para>The <guimenuitem>Load Settings</guimenuitem> section allows you to disable some features which are computationally expensive if you are on shared or restricted hosting.</para>

				<title>Avatar Settings</title>
				<para>Avatars are generally small, unique images a user can associate with themselves. Depending on the style, they are usually displayed below the user name when viewing topics. Here you can determine how users can define their avatars.</para>
				<para>There are several ways a user can add an avatar to their profile. The first way is through <guilabel>Gravatar</guilabel>. If this feature is enabled, users can choose to have the board load the Gravatar.com image associated with their email address.</para>
				<para>The second way is through an avatar gallery you provide. Note that there is no avatar gallery available in a default phpBB installation. The <guilabel>Avatar Gallery Path</guilabel> is the path to the gallery images. The default path is <guilabel>images/avatars/gallery</guilabel>. The gallery folder does not exist in the default installation so you have to add it manually if you want to use it.</para>
				<para>The images you want to use for your gallery need to be in a folder inside the gallery path. Images directly in the gallery path won't be recognised.</para>
				<para>The third approach to avatars is through <guilabel>Remote Avatars</guilabel>. These are simply images linked from another website. Your members can add a link to the image they want to use on the <guilabel>edit avatars</guilabel> page of their profile. To give you some control over the size of the avatars you can define the minimum and maximum size of the images. The disadvantage of <guilabel>Remote Avatars</guilabel> is that you are not able to control the file size.</para>
				<para>The fourth approach to avatars is through <guilabel>Avatar Uploading</guilabel>. Your members can upload an image from their local system which will be stored on your server. They will be uploaded into the <guilabel>Avatar Storage Path</guilabel> you can define. The default path is <guilabel>images/avatars/upload</guilabel> and does already exist after installation. You have to make sure that it is <glossterm>server-writable</glossterm>. The file format of the images has to be either gif, jpeg, or png, and the avatars will be automatically checked for their file and image size after the upload. You can adjust the <guilabel>Maximum Avatar File Size</guilabel> and images that are bigger than the allowed value will be discarded.</para>
				<para>Avatars can also be uploaded through <guilabel>Remote Uploading</guilabel> which allows users to provide a URL to an image and have it downloaded to the board for use as their avatar. This allows you to keep the avatars locally instead of having external links to image hosts.</para>

				<title>Private Messaging</title>
				<para><glossterm>Private Messages</glossterm> are a way for registered members to communicate privately through your board without the need to fall back to e-mail or instant messaging. </para>
				<para>You can disable this feature with the <guilabel>Private Messaging</guilabel> setting. This will keep the feature turned off for the whole board. You can disable private messages for selected users or groups with <link linkend="acp_permissions">Permissions</link>. Please see the <link linkend="acp_permissions">Permissions section</link> for more information. </para>
				<para>Rhea allows users to create own personal folders to organise Private Messages. The <guilabel>Maximum private message folders</guilabel> setting defines the number of message folders they can create. The default value is 4. You can disable the feature with setting value to 0. </para>
				<para><guilabel>Max Private Messages Per Box</guilabel> sets the number of Private Messages each folder can contain. The default value is <guilabel>50</guilabel>, Set it to 0 to allow unlimited messages per folder. </para>
				<para>If you limit the number of messages users can store in their folders, you need to define a default action that is taken once a folder is full. This can be changed in the &quot;Full Folder Default Action&quot; list. The oldest message gets deleted or the new message will be held back until the folder has place for it. Note that users will be able to choose this for themselves in their PM options and this setting only changes the default value they face. This will not override the action a user chosen. </para>
				<para>When sending a private message, it is still possible to edit the message until the recipient reads it. After a sent private message has been read, editing the message is no longer possible. To limit the time a message can be edited before the recipient reads it, you can set the <guilabel>Limit Editing Time</guilabel>. The default value is 0, which allows editing until the message is read. Note that you can disallow users or groups to edit Private Messages after sending through <link linkend="acp_permissions">Permissions</link>. If the permission to edit messages is denied, it will override this setting. </para>
				<para>The <guilabel>General Options</guilabel> allow you to further define the functionality of Private Messages on your board. 
					<itemizedlist>
						<listitem>
							<para><guilabel>Allow Mass PMs:</guilabel> enables the sending of Private Messages to multiple recipients. This feature is enabled by default. Disabling it will also disallow sending of Private Messages to groups. </para>

						</listitem>

			<title>Server configuration</title>
			<para>As an administrator of a board, being able to fine-tune the settings that your phpBB board uses for the server is a must. Configuring your board's server settings is very easy. There are five main categories of server settings: <guimenuitem>Cookie settings</guimenuitem>, <guimenuitem>Server settings</guimenuitem>, <guimenuitem>Security settings</guimenuitem>, <guimenuitem>Load settings</guimenuitem>, and <guimenuitem>Search settings</guimenuitem>. Properly configuring these settings will help your board not only function, but also work efficiently and as intended. The following subsections will outline each server configuration category. Once you are done with updating settings in each setting, remember to click <guilabel>Submit</guilabel> to apply your changes.</para>

				<title>Cookie settings</title>
				<para>Your board uses cookies all the time. Cookies can store information and data; for example, cookies are what enable users to automatically login to the board when they visit it. The settings on this page define the data used to send cookies to your users' browsers.</para>
				
				<warning>
					<para>When editing your board's cookie settings, do so with caution. Incorrect settings can cause such consequences as preventing your users from logging in.</para>
				</warning>
				
				<para>To edit your board's cookie settings, locate the <guilabel>Cookie Settings</guilabel> form. The following are four settings you may edit:
				
					<itemizedlist>
						<title>Cookie Settings</title>
						<listitem><para><guilabel>Cookie domain</guilabel>: This is the domain that your board runs on. Do not include the path that phpBB is installed in; only the domain itself is important here.</para></listitem>
						<listitem><para><guilabel>Cookie name</guilabel>: This is the name that will be assigned to the cookie when it is sent to your users' browsers and stored. This should be a unique cookie name that will not conflict with any other cookies.</para></listitem>
						<listitem><para><guilabel>Cookie path</guilabel>: This is the path that the cookie will apply to. In most cases, this should be left as &quot;/&quot;, so that the cookie can be accessible across your site. If for some reason you must restrict the cookie to the path that your board is installed in, set the value to the path of your board.</para></listitem>
						<listitem><para><guilabel>Cookie secure</guilabel>: If your board is only accessible via <acronym>SSL</acronym>, set this to <guilabel>Enabled</guilabel>.

				<title>Server settings</title>
				<para>On this page, you can define server and domain-dependent settings. There are three main categories of server settings: <guilabel>Server Settings</guilabel>, <guilabel>Path Settings</guilabel>, and <guilabel>Server URL Settings</guilabel>. The following describes each server settings category and the corresponding settings in more detail. When you are done configuring your board's server settings, click <guilabel>Submit</guilabel> to submit your changes.</para>
				
				<warning>
					<para>When editing your board's server settings, do so with caution. Incorrect settings can cause such consequences as emails being sent out with incorrect links and/or information, or even the board being inaccessible.</para>
				</warning>
				
				<para>The <guilabel>Server Settings</guilabel> form allows you to set some settings that phpBB will use on the server level:
					<itemizedlist>
						<title>Server Settings</title>
						<listitem><para><guilabel>Enable GZip Compression</guilabel>: Setting this value will enable <glossterm>GZip</glossterm> compression on your server. This means that all content generated by the server will be compressed before it is sent to users' browsers, if the users' browsers support it. Though this can reduce network traffic/bandwidth used, this will also increase the server and CPU load, on both the user's and server's sides.</para></listitem>
						<listitem><para><guilabel>Run periodic tasks from system cron</guilabel>: When off, phpBB will arrange for periodic tasks to be run automatically when users visit the board. When on, phpBB will not schedule any periodic tasks by itself; a system administrator must arrange for <emphasis>bin/phpbbcli.php cron:run</emphasis> to be run by the system cron facility at regular intervals (e.g. every 5 minutes).</para></listitem>
					</itemizedlist>
				</para>

				<para>Next, the <guilabel>Path Settings</guilabel> form allows you to set the various paths that phpBB uses for certain board content. For default installations, the default settings should be sufficient. The following are the four values that you can set:
					<itemizedlist>
						<title>Path Settings</title>
						<listitem><para><guilabel>Enable URL Rewriting</guilabel>: When enabled, URLs containing "app.php" will be rewritten to remove the filename (i.e. app.php/foo will become /foo). This will generally only be seen if you install extensions. This feature is currently limited to Apache web servers with mod_rewrite enabled.</para></listitem>
						<listitem><para><guilabel>Smilies storage path</guilabel>: This is the path to the directory, relative to the directory that your board is installed in, that your smilies are located in.</para></listitem>
						<listitem><para><guilabel>Post icons storage path</guilabel>: This is the path to the directory, relative to the directory that your board is installed in, that the topic icons are stored in.</para></listitem>
						<listitem><para><guilabel>Extension group icons storage path</guilabel>: This is the path to the directory, relative to the directory that your board is installed in, that the icons for the <link linkend="acp_attach_extension_groups">attachments extension groups</link>.</para></listitem>
						<listitem><para><guilabel>Rank image storage path</guilabel>: This is the path to the directory, relative to the directory that your board is installed in, that your <link linkend="acp_user_ranks">rank images</link> are located in.</para></listitem>
					</itemizedlist>
				</para>
				
				<para>The last category of server settings is <guilabel>Server URL Settings</guilabel>. The <guilabel>Server URL Settings</guilabel> category contains settings that allow you to configure the actual <acronym>URL</acronym> that your board is located at, as well as the server protocol and port number that the board will be accessed to. The following are the five settings you may edit:
					<itemizedlist>
						<title>Server URL Settings</title>
						<listitem><para><guilabel>Force server URL settings</guilabel>: If for some reason the default settings for the server URL are incorrect, then you can force your phpBB board to use the server URL settings you specify below by selecting the <guilabel>Yes</guilabel> radio button.</para></listitem>
						<listitem><para><guilabel>Server protocol</guilabel>: This is the server protocol (http:// or https://, for example) that your board uses, if the default settings are forced. If this value is empty or the above <guilabel>Force server URL settings</guilabel> setting is disabled, then the protocol will be determined by the cookie secure settings.</para></listitem>
						<listitem><para><guilabel>Domain name</guilabel>: This is the name of the domain that your board runs on. Include &quot;www&quot; if applicable. Again, this value is only used if the server URL settings are forced.</para></listitem>
						<listitem><para><guilabel>Server port</guilabel>: This is the port that the server is running on. In most cases, a value of &quot;80&quot; is the port to set. You should only change this value if, for some reason, your server runs on a different port. Again, this value is only used if the server URL settings are forced.</para></listitem>
						<listitem><para><guilabel>Script path</guilabel>: This is the directory where phpBB is installed, relative to the domain name. For example, if your board was located at www.example.com/phpBB3/, the value to set for your script path is &quot;/phpBB3&quot;. Again, this value is only used if the server URL settings are forced.</para></listitem>

							<para>Usually, more complex passwords fare well; they are better than simple passwords. To help your users try to make their account as secure as possible, you also have the option of requiring that they use a password as complex as you define. This requirement will apply to all users registering a new account, or when existing users change their current passwords.</para>
							<para>There are four options in the selection menu. <guimenuitem>No requirements</guimenuitem> will disable password complexity checking completely. The <guimenuitem>Must be mixed case</guimenuitem> setting requires that your users' passwords have both lowercase and uppercase letters in their password. The <guimenuitem>Must contain alphanumerics</guimenuitem> setting requires that your users' password include both letters from the alphabet and numbers. Lastly, the <guimenuitem>Must contain symbols</guimenuitem> setting will require that your users' passwords include symbols.</para>
							<note>
								<para>For each password complexity requirement, the setting(s) above it in the selection menu will also apply. For example, selecting <guimenuitem>Must contain alphanumerics</guimenuitem> will require your users' passwords to include not only alphanumeric characters, but also have both lowercase and uppercase letters.</para>

				<title>Load settings</title>
				<para>On particularly large boards, it may be necessary to manage certain load-related settings in order to allow your board to run as smoothly as possible. However, even if your board isn't excessively active, it is still important to be able to adjust your board's load settings. Adjusting these settings properly can help reduce the amount of processing required by your server. Once you are done editing any of the server load-related settings, remember to click <guilabel>Submit</guilabel> to actually submit and apply your changes.</para>
				
				<para>The first group of settings, <guilabel>General Settings</guilabel>, allows you to control the very basic load-related settings, such as the maximum system load and session lengths. The following describes each option in detail.
					<itemizedlist>
						<title>General settings</title>
						<listitem><para><guilabel>Limit system load</guilabel>: This option enables you to control the maximum load that the server can undergo before the board will automatically go offline. Specifically, if the systemâ€™s one-minute load average exceeds this value, the board will automatically go offline. A value of &quot;1.0&quot; equals about 100% utilisation of one processor. Note that this option will only work with *nix-based servers that have this information accessible. If your board is unable to get the load limit, this value will reset itself to &quot;0&quot;. All positive numbers are valid values for this option. (For example, if your server has two processors, a setting of 2.0 would represent 100% server utilisation of both processors.) Set this to &quot;0&quot; if you do not want to enable this option.</para></listitem>
						<listitem><para><guilabel>Session length</guilabel>: This is the amount of time, in seconds, before your users' sessions expire. Valid values are positive integers greater than or equal to 60.</para></listitem>
						<listitem><para><guilabel>Limit sessions</guilabel>: It is also possible to control the maximum amount of sessions your board will handle before your board will go offline and be temporarily disabled. Specifically, if the number of sessions your board is serving exceeds this value within a one-minute period, the board will go offline and be temporarily disabled. All positive integers are valid values. Set this to &quot;0&quot; if you want to allow an unlimited amount of sessions.</para></listitem>
						<listitem><para><guilabel>View online time span</guilabel>: This is the number of minutes after which inactive users will not appear in the <guilabel>Who is Online</guilabel> listings. The higher the number given, the greater the processing power required to generate the listing. All positive integers are valid values, and indicate the number of minutes that the time span will be.</para></listitem>
					</itemizedlist>
				</para>
				
				<para>The second group of settings, <guilabel>General Options</guilabel>, allows you to control whether certain options are available for your users on your board. The following describes each option further.
					<itemizedlist>
						<title>General options</title>
						<listitem><para><guilabel>Enable dotted topics</guilabel>: Topics in which a poster has already posted in will see dotted topic icons for these topics. To enable this feature, select, <guilabel>Yes</guilabel>.</para></listitem>
						<listitem><para><guilabel>Enable server-side topic marking</guilabel>: One of the many new features phpBB3 offers is server-side read tracking. This is different from phpBB2, which only offered read tracking based on cookies. To store read/unread status information in the database, as opposed to in a cookie, select <guilabel>Yes</guilabel>.</para></listitem>
						<listitem><para><guilabel>Enable topic marking for guests</guilabel>: It is also possible to allow guests to have read/unread status information. If you want your board to store read/unread status information for guests, select <guilabel>Yes</guilabel>. If this option is disabled, posts will be displayed as &quot;read&quot; for guests.</para></listitem>
						<listitem><para><guilabel>Enable online user listings</guilabel>: The online user listings can be displayed on your board's index, in each forum, and on topic pages. If you want to enable this option and allow the online user listings to be displayed, choose <guilabel>Yes</guilabel>.</para></listitem>
						<listitem><para><guilabel>Enable online guest listings in viewonline</guilabel>: If you want to enable the display of guest user information in the <guilabel>Who is Online</guilabel> section, choose <guilabel>Yes</guilabel>.</para></listitem>
						<listitem><para><guilabel>Enable display of user online/offline information</guilabel>: This option allows you to control whether or not online/offline status information for users can be displayed in profiles and on the topic view pages. To enable this display option, choose <guilabel>Yes</guilabel>.</para></listitem>
						<listitem><para><guilabel>Enable birthday listing</guilabel>: In phpBB3, birthdays is a new feature. To enable the listing of birthdays, choose <guilabel>Yes</guilabel>.</para></listitem>
						<listitem><para><guilabel>Enable display of moderators</guilabel>: Though it can be particularly useful to list the moderators who moderate each forum, it is possible to disable this feature, which may help reduce the amount of processing required. To enable the display of moderators, select <guilabel>Yes</guilabel>.</para></listitem>
						<listitem><para><guilabel>Enable display of jumpbox</guilabel>: The jumpbox can be a useful tool for navigating throughout your board. However, it is possible to control whether or not this is displayed. To display the jumpboxes, select <guilabel>Yes</guilabel>.</para></listitem>
						<listitem><para><guilabel>Show user's activity</guilabel>: This option controls whether or not the active topic/forum information displayed in your users' profiles and <glossterm>UCP</glossterm>. If you want to show this user activity information, select <guilabel>Yes</guilabel>. However, if your board has more than one million posts, it is recommended that you disable this feature.</para></listitem>
						<listitem><para><guilabel>Recompile stale templates</guilabel>: This option controls the recompilation of old templates. If this is enabled, your board will check to see if there are updated templates on your filesystem; if there are, your board will recompile the templates. Select <guilabel>Yes</guilabel> to enable this option.</para></listitem>
						<listitem><para><guilabel>Allow usage of third party content delivery networks</guilabel>: If this setting is enabled, some files will be served from external third party servers (ajax.googleapis.com) instead of your server. This reduces the network bandwidth required by your server, but may present a privacy issue for some board administrators. In a default phpBB installation, this includes loading "jQuery" and the font "Open Sans" from Google's content delivery network.</para></listitem>
						<listitem><para><guilabel>Allow live searches</guilabel>: When enabled, certain search fields (memberlist searches) will automatically prompt with search results as you type.</para></listitem>
					</itemizedlist>
				</para>
				
				<para>Lastly, the last group of load settings relates to <guilabel>Custom Profile Fields</guilabel>, which are a new feature in phpBB3. The following describes these options in detail.
					<itemizedlist>
						<title>Custom Profile Fields</title>
						<listitem><para><guilabel>Allow styles to display custom profile fields in memberlist</guilabel>: This option allows you to control if your board's style(s) can display the custom profile fields (if your board has any) in the memberlist. To enable this, choose <guilabel>Yes</guilabel>.</para></listitem>
						<listitem><para><guilabel>Display custom profile fields in user profiles</guilabel>: If you want to enable the display of custom profile fields (if your board has any) in users' profiles, select <guilabel>Yes</guilabel>.</para></listitem>
						<listitem><para><guilabel>Display custom profile fields in viewtopic</guilabel>: If you want to enable the display of custom profile fields (if your board has any) in the topic view pages, choose <guilabel>Yes</guilabel>.</para></listitem>

Here, on the <guimenuitem>Search settings</guimenuitem> page, you can control what search backend your board's search functionality will use for indexing posts and searching, and set various options related to it. There are four main categories of search settings: <guilabel>General Search Settings</guilabel>, <guilabel>Search Backend</guilabel>, <guilabel>Fulltext mysql</guilabel>, and <guilabel>Fulltext native</guilabel>. The following describes each set of search settings in detail.</para>
			
				<para>The first group of search settings are general and user-facing, meaning that they concern the users who use the search functionality directly.
					<itemizedlist>
						<title>General Search Settings</title>
						<listitem><para><guilabel>Enable search facilities</guilabel>: Setting this option to <guilabel>Yes</guilabel> will enable the search functionality for your users; member-searching functionality will also be enabled.</para></listitem>
						<listitem><para><guilabel>User search flood interval</guilabel>: This value indicates the number of seconds that your users have to wait between consecutive searches. This value is checked independently for each user. All positive integers are valid values. If you want to disable checking for search intervals for users, set this value to &quot;0&quot;.</para></listitem>
						<listitem><para><guilabel>Guest search flood interval</guilabel>: This is the number of seconds between searches that guest users must wait. This value is shared for all guest users, if one guest searches, the others will have to wait until this interval passes. All positive integers are valid values. If you want to disable checking for search intervals for guests, set this value to &quot;0&quot;.</para></listitem>
						<listitem><para><guilabel>Search page system load limit</guilabel>: You can also limit the amount of load your system will undergo for searches. If the system load exceeds this value, your board will go offline and be temporarily disabled. All numbers between 0 and 1.0 (inclusive) are valid values. A value of &quot;1.0&quot;, for example, represents about 100% utilisation of a single processor; if the system load exceeds this value, the board will go offline. Note that this feature only works for *nix-based servers.</para></listitem>
						<listitem><para><guilabel>Min author name characters</guilabel>: Users have to enter at least this many characters of the name when performing a wildcard author search. If the author's username is shorter than this number, your users can still search for the author's posts by entering the complete username. All positive integers are valid values.</para></listitem>
						<listitem><para><guilabel>Search result cache length</guilabel>: phpBB3 can also cache search results. These cached search results will expire after this number of seconds. All positive integers are valid values. Set this value to &quot;0&quot; if you want to disable search caching.</para></listitem>
					</itemizedlist>
				</para>
				
				<para>The next group of search settings actually only contains one setting: choosing what backend your board's search facilities, if enabled, will use. The following details this option.
					<itemizedlist>
						<title>Search Backend</title>
						<listitem><para><guilabel>Search backend</guilabel>: This option specifies the backend that your board's search facilities will use if it is enabled. The backend is essentially the system/method that is actually responsible for conducting searches based on the queries it is given. There are four available options: <guimenuitem>MySQL Fulltext</guimenuitem>, <guimenuitem>phpBB Native Fulltext</guimenuitem>, <guimenuitem>PostgreSQL Fulltext</guimenuitem>, and <guimenuitem>Sphinx Fulltext</guimenuitem>.</para></listitem>
					</itemizedlist>
					<note>
						<para>If you choose to change your board's current search backend, you will have to create an index of your board's content for the new search backend. If you know for sure that you're not going to use the index that was used with your old, previously chosen search backend, you can also delete it in order to free up some of your system's resources. To learn more about maintaining your board's search indices, see <xref linkend="acp_maintenance_search" />.</para>
					</note>
				</para>
				
				<para><guimenuitem>MySQL Fulltext</guimenuitem> will make your board use MySQL's fulltext search as its search backend. This causes the SQL server to perform the searches, rather than building our own search tables. The settings shown are informational only and require the server's system administrator for changes to be made.
					<itemizedlist>
						<title>Fulltext mysql</title>
						<listitem><para><guilabel>Support for non-latin UTF-8 characters using PCRE</guilabel>: This tells you if your system supports searching for non-Latin <acronym>UTF</acronym>-8 characters. This is only available in <glossterm>PHP</glossterm> versions 4.4 and above, and 5.1 and above. This is only relevant if you actually want your users to have the ability to search for non-Latin characters.</para></listitem>
						<listitem><para><guilabel>Support for non-latin UTF-8 characters using mbstring</guilabel>: If your system doesn't support UTF-8 characters using <acronym>PCRE</acronym> (as indicated in the setting above), the mySQL fulltext search backend will try to use mbstring's regular expression engine. Again, this is only relevant if you actually want your users to have the ability to seasrch for non-Latin characters.</para></listitem>
					</itemizedlist>
				</para>

				<para><guimenuitem>phpBB Native Fulltext</guimenuitem> is the default option, which is phpBB's own native fulltext search.
					<itemizedlist>
						<title>Fulltext native</title>
						<listitem><para><guilabel>Enable fulltext updating</guilabel>: This option allows you to control whether or not your board's search index will update when posts are made. If you would like to enable this, choose <guilabel>Yes</guilabel>. Note that this setting is not relevant if your board's search functionality is disabled entirely.</para></listitem>
						<listitem><para><guilabel>Min characters indexed by search</guilabel>: You can also control the minimum number of characters words must contain in order to be included in your board's search index. It is recommended that you not set this too low in order to have a quality search index. All positive integers are valid values.</para></listitem>
						<listitem><para><guilabel>Max characters indexed by search</guilabel>: Just like the above setting, you can also control the maximum number of characters words must contain in order to be included in your board's search index. If a word has more than this number of characters in it, it will not be included in the search index. All positive integers are valid values.</para></listitem>
						<listitem><para><guilabel>Common word threshold</guilabel>: Like phpBB2's stopwords feature, you can prevent the use of common words that you specify. However, this feature is expanded upon in phpBB3. You can now control the threshold that a word can have; this means that if a word is contained in more than a certain percentage of posts on your board, it will be deemed as a common word, and will be ignored in search queries. All positive integers are valid values, and represent the percentage of posts on your board words can be contained in. If you would like to disable this threshold and thereby allow searches using all words, even if they can be common, set this value to &quot;0&quot;. This setting only applies if your board has more than 100 posts.</para></listitem>
					</itemizedlist>
				</para>

				<para><guimenuitem>PostgreSQL Fulltext</guimenuitem> is similar to MySQL Fulltext, but for sites running on a PostgreSQL database.
					<itemizedlist>
						<title>PostgreSQL Fulltext</title>
						<listitem><para><guilabel>PostgreSQL version</guilabel>: This indicates if you are running a version of PostgreSQL that supports Fulltext searches. This feature is available in PostgreSQL 8.3 and above.</para></listitem>
						<listitem><para><guilabel>Text search Configuration Profile</guilabel>: If your database server has multiple search configurations created, you can choose between them here. The default is <emphasis>simple</emphasis>, though a language specific one may be more appropriate if your board contains non-Latin text.</para></listitem>
						<listitem><para><guilabel>Minimum word length for keywords</guilabel>: You can also control the minimum number of characters words must contain in order to be included in your board's search index. It is recommended that you not set this too low in order to have a quality search index. All positive integers are valid values.</para></listitem>
						<listitem><para><guilabel>Maximum word length for keywords</guilabel>: Just like the above setting, you can also control the maximum number of characters words must contain in order to be included in your board's search index. If a word has more than this number of characters in it, it will not be included in the search index. All positive integers are valid values.</para></listitem>
					</itemizedlist>
				</para>

				<para><guimenuitem>Sphinx Fulltext</guimenuitem> makes use of a special search server called <ulink url="http://sphinxsearch.com/">Sphinx</ulink>. Sphinx will need to be installed prior to configuring it here. If you have a large board with hundreds of thousands of posts or more, you will most likely want to use Sphinx.
					<itemizedlist>
						<title>Sphinx Fulltext</title>
						<listitem><para><guilabel>Path to data directory</guilabel>: The absolute path to the data directory where Sphinx should store its indices and log files. The path should have a slash at the end.</para></listitem>
						<listitem><para><guilabel>Sphinx search daemon host</guilabel>: The hostname or IP address of the search server. Leave blank for localhost.</para></listitem>
						<listitem><para><guilabel>Sphinx search daemon port</guilabel>: The port which the search server is operating on. Leave blank for its default port 9312.</para></listitem>
						<listitem><para><guilabel>Indexer memory limit</guilabel>: The amount of memory the search server is allowed to use. This value should be less than the maximum amount of available memory on the system.</para></listitem>
						<listitem><para><guilabel>Sphinx config file</guilabel>: The generated output for your sphinx.conf file for the search server.</para></listitem>
					</itemizedlist>
					After submitting the form, a Sphinx search table will be created in the database. The search indexers must still be started manually before the indices are created. The exact commands needed to do that and more can be found on the wiki: <ulink url="https://wiki.phpbb.com/Sphinx_Fulltext_Search">Development Wiki: Sphinx Fulltext Search</ulink>.

			<title>Subforums</title>
			<para>One of the features in phpBB 3.2 is <glossterm>subforums</glossterm>. Especially bulletin boards with a high number of forums will benefit from this. In the simple flat category and forum approach in phpBB 2.0, all forums and categories were listed on the forum index. In Rhea you can now put as many forums, links, or categories as you like inside other forums.</para>
			<!-- (TODO: Diagram of a 2.0 / 3.0 comparison) -->
			<para>If you have a forum about pets for instance, you are able to put subforums for cats, dogs, or guinea pigs inside it without making the parent "Pets" forum a category. In this example, only the "Pets" forum will be listed on the index like a normal forum. Its subforums will appear as simple links below the forum description (unless you disabled this).</para>

			<para>This system theoretically allows unlimited levels of subforums. You can put as many subforums inside subforums as you like. However, please do not go overboard with this feature. On boards with five to ten forums or less, it is not a good idea to use subforums. Remember, the less forums you have, the more active your forum will appear. You can always add more forums later.</para>

			<title>BBCodes</title>
			
			<para><glossterm>BBCodes</glossterm> are a special way of formatting posts, similar to HTML. phpBB 3.2 allows you to create your own BBCodes very easily. On this page, you can see the custom BBCodes that currently exist.</para>
			<para>Adding a BBCode is very easy. If done right, allowing users to use your new BBCode may be safer than allowing them to use HTML code. To add a BBCode, click <guilabel>Add a new BBCode</guilabel> to begin. There are four main things to consider when adding a BBCode: how you want your users to use the BBCode, what HTML code the BBcode will actually use (the users will not see this), what short info message you want for the BBCode, and whether or not you want a button for the new BBCode to be displayed on the posting screen. Once you are done configuring all of the custom BBCode settings, click <guilabel>Submit</guilabel> to add your new BBCode.</para>

						<para>Creating a new BBCode. In this example, we are creating a new [font] BBCode that will allow users to specify the font face of the specified text.</para>
					</caption>
				</mediaobject>
			</figure>
			
			<para>In the <guilabel>BBCode Usage</guilabel> form, you can define how you want your users to use the BBCode. Let's say you want to create a new font BBCode that will let your users pick a font to use for their text. An example of what to put under <guilabel>BBCode Usage</guilabel> would be
				<code>[font={SIMPLETEXT}]{TEXT}[/font]</code>
				This would make a new [font] BBCode, and will allow the user to pick what font face they want for the text. The user's text is represented by <guilabel>TEXT</guilabel>, while <guilabel>SIMPLETEXT</guilabel> represents whatever font name the user types in.
			</para>
			<para>In the <guilabel>HTML Replacement</guilabel> form, you can define what HTML code your new BBCode will use to actually format the text. In the case of making a new [font] BBCode, try
				<code>&lt;span style="font-family: {SIMPLETEXT}"&gt;{TEXT}&lt;span&gt;</code>
				This HTML code will be used to actually format the user's text.
			</para>
			<para>The third option to consider when adding a custom BBCode is what sort of help message you want to display to your users if they choose to use the new BBCode. Ideally, the helpline message is a short note or tip for the user using the BBCode. This message will be displayed below the BBCode row on the posting screens.</para>
			<note>
				<para>If the next option described, <guilabel>Display on posting</guilabel>, isn't enabled, the helpline message will not be displayed.</para>
			</note>
			<para>Lastly, when adding a new BBCode, you can decide whether or not you want an actual BBCode button for your new BBCode to be displayed on the posting screens. If you want this, then check the <guilabel>Display on posting</guilabel> checkbox.</para>
			<para>It is important to choose appropriate tokens when creating your custom BBCodes. The tokens limit the type of input that they will accept. If you want to only allow URLs, use the <guilabel>URL</guilabel> token. If you only want to allow numbers, use the <guilabel>NUMBER</guilabel> token.</para>

			<title>Topic icons</title>
			
			<para>A new feature in phpBB3 is the ability to assign icons to topics. On this page, you can manage what topic icons are available for use on your board. You can add, edit, delete, or move topic icons. The <guilabel>Topic Icons</guilabel> form displays the topic icons currently installed on your board. You can add topic icons manually, install a premade icons pack, export or download an icons pack file, or edit your currently installed topic icons.</para>
		
			<para>Your first option to add topic icons to your board is to use a premade icons pack. Icon packs have the file extension <filename>pak</filename>. To install an icons pack, you must first download an icons pack. Upload the icon files themselves and the pack file into the <filename>/images/icons/</filename> directory. Then, click <guilabel>Install icons pak</guilabel>. The <guilabel>Install icons pak</guilabel> form displays all of the options you have regarding topic icon installation. Select the icon pack you wish to add (you may only install one icon pack at a time).

			<para>One of the many new features in phpBB3 that enhance the user experience is <guilabel>Custom Profile Fields</guilabel>. In the past, users could only fill in information in the common profile fields that were displayed; administrators had to add MODifications to their board to accommodate their individual needs. In phpBB3, however, administrators can comfortably create custom profile fields through the <acronym>ACP</acronym>.</para>
		
			<para>To create your custom profile field, login to your ACP. Click on the <guimenuitem>Users and Groups</guimenuitem> tab, and then locate the <guimenuitem>Custom profile fields</guimenuitem> link in the left-hand menu to click on. You should now be on the proper page. Locate the empty textbox below the custom profile fields headings, which is next to a selection menu and a <guilabel>Create new field</guilabel> button. Type in the empty textbox the name of the new profile field you want to create first. Then, select the field type in the selection menu. Available options are <guimenuitem>Numbers</guimenuitem>, <guimenuitem>Single text field</guimenuitem>, <guimenuitem>Textarea</guimenuitem>, <guimenuitem>Boolean (Yes/No)</guimenuitem>, <guimenuitem>Dropdown box</guimenuitem>, and <guimenuitem>Date</guimenuitem>. Click the <guilabel>Create new field</guilabel> button to continue. The following describes each of the three sets of settings that the new custom profile field will have.
				<itemizedlist>
					<title>Add profile field</title>
					<listitem><para><guilabel>Field type:</guilabel> This is the kind of the field that your new custom profile field is. That means that it can consist of numbers, dates, etc. This should already be set.</para></listitem>
					<listitem><para><guilabel>Field identification:</guilabel> This is the name of the profile field. This name will identify the profile field within phpBB3's database and templates.</para></listitem>
					<listitem><para><guilabel>Display profile field:</guilabel> This setting determines if the new profile field will be displayed at all. The profile field will be shown on topic pages, profiles and the memberlist if this is enabled within the load settings. Only showing within the users profile is enabled by default.</para></listitem>
				</itemizedlist>
				
				<itemizedlist>
					<title>Visibility option</title>
					<listitem><para><guilabel>Display in user control panel:</guilabel> This setting determines if your users will be able to change the profile field within the <acronym>UCP</acronym>.</para></listitem>
					<listitem><para><guilabel>Display at registration screen:</guilabel> If this option is enabled, the profile field will be displayed on the registration page. Users will be able to be change this field within the <acronym>UCP</acronym>.</para></listitem>
					<listitem><para><guilabel>Required field:</guilabel> This setting determines if you want to force your users to fill in this profile field. This will display the profile field at registration and within the user control panel.</para></listitem>
					<listitem><para><guilabel>Hide profile field:</guilabel> If this option is enabled, this profile field will only show up in users' profiles. Only administrators and moderators will be able to see or fill out this field in this case.</para></listitem>

					<title>Language specific options</title>

			<title>Managing ranks</title>
			
			<para>Ranks are special titles that can be applied to forum users. As an administrator, it is up to you to create and manage the ranks that exist on your board. The actual names for the ranks are completely up to you; it's usually best to tailor them to the main purpose of your board.</para>
			
			<note>
				<para>When assigning a special rank name to a user, remember that no permissions are associated. For example, if you create a &quot;Support Moderator&quot; rank and assign it to a user, that user will not automatically get moderator permissions. You must assign the user the special permissions separately.</para>
			</note>
			
			<para>To manage your board's ranks, login to your <acronym>ACP</acronym>, click on the <guimenuitem>Users and Groups</guimenuitem> tab, and then click on the <guimenuitem>Manage ranks</guimenuitem> link located in the left-hand menu. You should now be on the rank management page. All current existing ranks are displayed.</para>
			
			<para>To create a new rank, click on the <guilabel>Add new rank</guilabel> button located below the existing ranks list. Fill in the first field <guilabel>Rank title</guilabel> with the name of the rank. If you uploaded an image you want to attribute to the rank into the <filename>/images/ranks/</filename> folder, you can select an image from the selection menu. The last setting you can set is if you want the rank to be a "special" rank. Special ranks are ranks that administrators assign to users; they are not automatically assigned to users based on their postcount. If you selected <guilabel>No</guilabel>, then you can fill in the <guilabel>Minimum posts</guilabel> field with the minimum number of posts your users must have before getting assigned this rank. When you are done, click the <guilabel>Submit</guilabel> button to add this new rank.</para>
			
			<para>To edit a rank's current settings, locate the rank's row, and then click on its "Edit" button located in the <guilabel>Action</guilabel> column.</para>
			
			<para>To delete a rank, locate the rank's row, and then click on its "Delete" button located in the <guilabel>Action</guilabel> column. Then, you must confirm the action by clicking on the <guilabel>Yes</guilabel> button when prompted.</para>

				<title>Ban IPs</title>
				<para>Sometimes, it is necessary to ban <glossterm>IP address</glossterm>es or hostnames in order to prevent unwanted users.

		<title>Permissions</title>
		<para>On your board, you will need to control what users can and cannot do, and what they can and cannot see. With the flexible and detailed system that Rhea provides, you have an extensive ability to manage permissions. There are five types of permissions in phpBB3:</para>
		<itemizedlist>

			<listitem><para>Global Moderator permissions</para></listitem>

		</itemizedlist>
		<para>The three <guilabel>Global permissions</guilabel> are ones which apply to every forum or are unrelated to forums altogether.</para>
		<para>The two <guilabel>Forum permissions</guilabel> are ones which apply to only one forum at a time.</para>
		<para>Any of these five permission types may be assigned to individual users or to usergroups.</para>
		<para>When setting permissions, you will encounter three possible values - <guilabel>NO</guilabel>, <guilabel>YES</guilabel> and <guilabel>NEVER</guilabel>, with <guilabel>NO</guilabel> as the default value for each permission. If you set a <guilabel>YES</guilabel>, it overrides the <guilabel>NO</guilabel>, however, if the permission is set to <guilabel>NEVER</guilabel>, you cannot override it by setting it to <guilabel>YES</guilabel> in another place. If you still have problems understanding this system, see the <link linkend="acp_permissions_mask">Permissions Masks</link> section.</para>
		<para>To understand how to set permissions and to know how to use the interface, it is important to recognize the different types of permissions and tools that the Permission tab in the ACP provides:</para>

			<title>Global Permissions</title>
			<para>These affect the whole board and are not bound to specific forums. They include user permissions, which limit the use of the UCP, searching, private messaging, using of avatars/signatures/etc. Administrator permissions are also set here, as they are Global.</para>

			<section id="acp_permissions_global_user">
				<title>Global User Permissions</title>
				<para>Global User permissions are those permissions which apply to all forums, such as permissions to attach or download files or use a signature, or permissions which are unrelated to a forum, such as permissions relating to profiles, private messages, and email.</para>

				<para>Although Global User permissions can be assigned to users by click <guilabel>Users’ Permissions</guilabel> from your ACP Permissions tab, selecting a user, and then selecting <guilabel>User permissions</guilabel> from the <guilabel>Select type</guilabel> dropdown, it is generally far preferable to avoid using User permissions and use Group permissions instead. This will make it easier to manage permissions in the future and to assign permissions to users in the future. The only practical difference between User permissions and Group permissions is that User permissions require you to set permissions for each user individually, where Group permission let you create a Group and assign its members a set of permissions. Then, if you wish other users to have the same permissions, you can just add them to the Group.</para>

				<para>Global user permissions can be assigned to user groups by clicking <guilabel>Groups’ permissions</guilabel> from your ACP Permissions tab, selecting a user group, and then selecting <guilabel>User permissions</guilabel> from the <guilabel>Select type</guilabel> dropdown.</para>

				<para>In either case, you will be allowed to select a stock User Role in the dropdown, or you can click <guilabel>Advanced Permissions</guilabel> to customise the permissions. However, the better way to customise one of the stock Roles is to create a new User role based on the settings of an existing Role. You can alse create a new User role from scratch. Roles use fewer resource than if you make modifications by editing the Advanced permissions.</para>
			</section>
			<section id="acp_permissions_global_moderator">

			<title>Forum Permissions</title>
			<para>These permissions are set for each forum/user or group combination individually. They can be divided into two types: User permissions and Moderator permissions. The first control if a user or group can see the forum, post in it, and so on, while the Moderator permissions control if the user or group can do moderator-related actions in it.</para>

				<para>User Forum permissions are those which apply to creating and editing ones own posts in a particular forum and printing and reporting topics.

		<section id="acp_permissions_roles">
			<title>Permission Roles</title>
			<para>To ease setting of permissions, you can create roles that have a pre-defined set of permissions and which you can then assign to users or groups. phpBB already prepared some predefined roles for you to use - e.g., in forum based permissions, you can make each user a Standard Moderator, Full Moderator or Limited Moderator, etc.</para>

			<para>There are four types of Permission Roles:
				<itemizedlist>
					<listitem><para>Admin Roles, used with <guilabel>Global Administrator permissions</guilabel></para></listitem>
					<listitem><para>User Roles, used with <guilabel>Global User permissions</guilabel></para></listitem>
					<listitem><para>Moderator Roles, used with <guilabel>Global Moderator permissions</guilabel> and <guilabel>Forum Moderator permissions</guilabel></para></listitem>
					<listitem><para>Forum Roles, used with <guilabel>User Forum permissions</guilabel></para></listitem>
				</itemizedlist>
			</para>

			<para>Permission Roles can be maintained by clicking the corresponding link on the ACP Permissions tab. Roles provide a convenient permissions template to use when assigning permissions to either users or user groups. A Role’s permissions settings can be viewed or edited by clicking the green-gear for that role.</para>

			<para>Most standard Roles use combinations of <guilabel>Yes</guilabel> and <guilabel>No</guilabel>, meaning that if one user is assigned two different roles from being a member of two different groups, for instance Limited Access and Regular Access, the <guilabel>Yes</guilabel>es will override the <guilabel>No</guilabel>s and leave the user with Regular Access.</para>

			<para>The Exceptions are the ones with <guilabel>Never</guilabel> settings, such as the User Roles <guilabel>No Avatar</guilabel> , <guilabel>No PMs</guilabel> and <guilabel>Newly Registered User Features</guilabel>, and the Forum Role <guilabel>On Moderation Queue</guilabel>. These  four Roles use <guilabel>Never</guilabel> settings, and therefore override the <guilabel>Yes</guilabel> settings that would have been granted by other roles.</para>

			<para>You should never use one of these  four roles, or any other <guilabel>Never</guilabel> settings with your Registered Users group. Doing so will take those permissions away from everyone, including yourself.</para>

			<para>If a Role’s permission settings are not quite right for your forum -- for instance, you don’t want anyone to be able to hide their online status -- you can add or subtract a permission to or from a standard Role. Then  wherever that role is used, that permission will be changed.</para>

			<para>You can also create your own custom roles by typing a new name into the <guilabel>Create role</guilabel> box, selecting a role to copy from in the <guilabel>Use settings from</guilabel> dropdown, and click submit. Then you can customise your new role and use it for assigning those permissions.</para>

			<para>Using such custom roles is simpler than editing the advanced permissions for multiple forums and should reduce the resources required by your forum when checking permissions.</para>
		</section>
		<section id="acp_permissions_mask">
			<title>Permission Masks</title>
			<para>In this section, you do not set or change anything, but you can view the final permissions a user or group has based on the combined result of the permissions a user has from his user permissions or group memberships. This feature is particularly useful when you need to debug your permissions and for example, you cannot find out why someone doesn’t have the permission you want him to have. Permission masks is a tool for viewing the permission settings for all five permissions types for both users and user groups.</para>

			<para>Each link on the Permissions Masks section of the ACP Permissions tab corresponds to one of the five permission types:
				<itemizedlist>
					<listitem><para>View administrative permissions for <guilabel>Global Administrator permissions</guilabel></para></listitem>
					<listitem><para>View user-based permissions for <guilabel>Global User permissions</guilabel></para></listitem>
					<listitem><para>View global moderation permissions for <guilabel>Global Moderator permissions</guilabel></para></listitem>
					<listitem><para>View forum moderation permissions for <guilabel>Forum Moderators permissions</guilabel></para></listitem>
					<listitem><para>View forum-based permissions for <guilabel>User Forum permissions</guilabel></para></listitem>
				</itemizedlist>
			Any of these five links will take you to a page listing the users and user groups that are assigned those Global or Forum permissions.</para>

			<para>Selecting one or more user groups will display the permissions for those user groups, the same way they are shown in the permissions edit pages, so there is no added utility in running the masks on group names. Permissions masks are most useful when run on a username, and not a group name, since the latter will give you only the same information provided by viewing that group’s permissions.</para>

			<para>Viewing a user’s permissions is much different. If you type a user’s name into the <guilabel>Find a member</guilabel> box for any of the five permission types and click <guilabel>View permissions</guilabel> it will display that user’s resulting permissions, taking into account all of the user's groups’ permissions. Also, the <guilabel>forum moderation</guilabel> mask will take into account global moderation permissions as well.</para>

			<para>Each individual permission will have a circle-arrow which is a link to display all of that user’s groups and which groups grant or deny that permission.</para>

				<para>After you choose a style and you are ready to install it, unpack it on your PC and upload the directory with the style to your board's server. Make sure that the directory you upload to the server's <filename class='directory'>styles</filename> contains the <filename class='directory'>template</filename> and <filename class='directory'>theme</filename> directories, as well as a <filename class='file'>style.cfg</filename> file. The only exception is when a style has its template or theme based on another one, you will however be informed of that when you download the style. Having the dependent style component installed is required to install such a style.</para>
			
				<para>Since you have uploaded all the necessary files, you can continue to install your style. Go to the <guilabel>Customise</guilabel> tab in the ACP and click the <guilabel>Install Styles</guilabel> link. You should see a table containing a list of your uploaded styles. If you want to install your downloaded style, click the <guilabel>Install style</guilabel> link next to its title.</para>

You also have the option of completely deleting the style as well if you check the <guilabel>Delete from filesystem</guilabel> box. This will uninstall the style and delete its files, this cannot be undone.</para></listitem>
					<listitem><para><guilabel>Preview</guilabel>: This is a very useful and powerful feature for administrators. If you click this link, you will be taken to the board and the style you have selected will be applied - this is great when you want to see if the style looks good on your board and you want to make sure you should activate it. This feature can be used even with deactivated styles. The style ID is passed through the URL, so you can browse through the board and see any page you need.</para></listitem>

			<title>Language Packs</title>
			<para>In phpBB, you can upload several language packs for your users to use. Every text string displayed by the system should be translated after you upload a new language pack. Using a different language pack does not change the contents of posts, as translating them is not possible due to the various content they can have and the limits of computer translation.</para>
			<para>Language packs can be downloaded from the <ulink url="https://www.phpbb.com/downloads/">Downloads</ulink> page on phpbb.com.</para>
			<para>To add a language pack, unzip the downloaded file and upload the contents, that is the <filename class='directory'>language</filename> and <filename class='directory'>styles</filename> directories, to the root directory of your board. The board's <filename class='directory'>language/</filename> directory should then contain an addtional directory with the name of the ISO code of the added language, for example, if French is added in addition to the default British English pack, the <filename class='directory'>en/</filename> directory, there will also be a <filename class='directory'>fr/</filename> directory. After you upload the files to the system, the pack should show in the <guilabel>Uninstalled language packs</guilabel> list. Click <guilabel>Install</guilabel> to add it to the board and make it available for users.</para>
			<para>Once the language pack is installed users can select it in User Control Panel &#187; Board preferences &#187; Edit global settings.</para>
			<note>
				<para>To make a language pack the default language of the board, you need to change the <link linkend="acp_general_config">Board Configuration</link>.</para>
			</note>
			<para>In case you have more language packs installed and you select another language pack than the default one, you will see a list of untranslated variables if the packs are not synchronised. This is useful when you install MODs for one language and you cannot find what language strings you are missing in the other ones for example.</para>
			<important>
				<para>Language packs, other than the default British English, are not automatically updated when the board is updated. If you have installed other language packs you will need to update those as well.</para>

			<title>Database backup and restore</title>
			<para>phpBB uses a database to store all the data used on the board, including users, posts, topics etc. Backing up the database can be useful as a protective measure in case of any accidents which could cause data loss or damage to the database. If any accident like this would occur, you would have a possibility to restore the database to a previous state from the backup. You can use the backup tool to move your board to another host - you will make a backup on your current server and restore it on the new one to keep all data.</para>
			<itemizedlist>
				<title>Database backup</title>
				<listitem><para><guilabel>Backup type</guilabel>: You can backup the whole database or you can either backup the <guilabel>structure</guilabel> or <guilabel>data</guilabel>. The structure only contains the hiearchy in which the data is stored, on the other side, if you only backup the data, you will need a pre-prepared structure when restoring/importing data.</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para><guilabel>File type</guilabel>: Depending on your server setup, you can save the backup in several formats. The <guilabel>Text</guilabel> option saves the backup in plain text, other options compress the file to decrease the filesize of the dump.</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para><guilabel>Action</guilabel>: You have three options: you can both <guilabel>Store and download</guilabel> the file, saving it in the store directory and downloading it to your PC, or you can choose to <guilabel>download</guilabel> or <guilabel>store</guilabel> the file.</para></listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para><guilabel>Table select</guilabel>: You can either <guilabel>Select all</guilabel> tables or you can select individual tables to backup. When backing up a large database, you can exclude the search tables (do not forget to restore their structure) and recreate the search index on the new server.</para>

			<title>Search Indexing</title>
			<para>phpBB 3.2 provides you with a powerful search system which can be used to search throughout your board. The main controls for the search features are located in the <link linkend="acp_server_search">Search settings</link> section. Here you can manage the <guilabel>search index</guilabel>, which is used to hold the data necessary for quick and precise search results, it's something like an giant table of contents. By default, two search backends are available - fulltext native, which is included in the phpBB code and works on all <glossterm>DBMS</glossterm>s, and fulltext mysql, which uses the built-in MySQL fulltext searching feature. The first one offers more flexible configuration, while the second one doesn't take too much space in the database and the index is created much faster.</para>
			<note>
				<para>Creating a search index can take a very long time, a new window will pop up and refresh itself while creating the necessary search table entries. Please be patient, the process can take several hours on large boards.</para>
			</note>
			<para>The fulltext native backend works like this: it uses two tables, one containing the words, which are used on the board and which have a numeric ID assigned and a second table, which links post IDs to word IDs. This system is very fast when you need to search a specific word(s) in the whole database, the following statistics, which are offered on the Search Index page, describe how many words and relations the system holds:</para>
			<variablelist>
				<varlistentry>
					<term><guilabel>Total number of indexed words</guilabel></term>
					<listitem>
						<para>This setting is quite self-explanatory, it is the number of different words that have ever been posted to your board. Only words that match the criteria for indexing, set in the <link linkend="acp_server_search">Search settings</link>, are considered.</para>
					</listitem>
				</varlistentry>
				<varlistentry>
					<term><guilabel>Total number of word to post relations indexed</guilabel></term>
					<listitem>
						<para>As described above, the second search table holds a list of relations between the posts and words. For example if someone would post "airplane" in two different posts, the system would add the word once and it would add to relations, one to each post.</para>
					</listitem>
				</varlistentry>
				<varlistentry>
					<term><guilabel>Total number of indexed posts</guilabel></term>
					<listitem>
						<para>This statistic is shown for the mysql fulltext backend, where the search is done by a internal mechanism of the Database system. It tells you how many posts on the board were indexed.</para>

		<title>System Configuration</title>
		<para>Controls which affect the whole board and which are a key part of configuring and running phpBB are located in the System section. Most of these settings require more attention from the administrator and are not so easy to configure, fortunately you will probably not be changing them too often. This includes keeping your installation up-to-date, managing the board's languages or editing the structure of phpBB's control panels.</para>

			<title>Checking for updates</title>
			<para>The phpBB 3.2.x branch is usually updated every couple of months as necessary. Bugfixes, new features and other changes are included in these updates. The minor version number gets incremented each time. It is strongly recommended to keep your phpBB installation up to date. Updating from older versions is more difficult and you will have a hard time finding solutions to possible conflicts. You can update with the Automatic Update Package, which is able to merge modifications from MODs with the updates or you can use one of the other packages provided.</para>
			<para>You will be notified in your ACP if a new version is released, you will also have a link to the newest release announcement, which will brief you on the added features and the overall changelog.</para>
			<para>Updating with the Automatic Update Package is very simple. First, you will go to the linked phpBB.com downloads page and download the appropriate file. You will extract the contents on your PC and upload them to the root directory of your board. The board will be offline for normal users for the moment. Then simply go to the <filename class='directory'>install/</filename> directory and select the <guilabel>Update</guilabel> tab, the updater will then give you further instructions.</para>

			<title>Managing Search Robots</title>
			<para>phpBB 3 introduced a new system for managing search indexer and bot accounts. It allows you to identify these automated bots by their IP or a part of their user-agent, which is a setting that normally identifies the browser of a user. After you add a bot and it is recognized, phpBB does not treat the session as anonymous, but uses the created bot account. Bots use permissions set by the predefined Bots group. Identifying bots is important so that phpBB can serve them content which is more appropriate for search engines - dead links to pages without content are omitted, e.g. posting pages, report post pages etc. Bots never receive a session ID in the URL, which should not appear in the search results. You can also assign a specific style and language to bots.</para>
			<para>You can easily track if a specific search indexer visited your site recently by checking the <guilabel>Last Visit</guilabel> column on the botlist page.</para>
			<note>
				<para>Bots do not use permissions from the Guest group, but permissions from the Bots group. For more about predefined groups, please read <xref linkend="acp_groups_types"/></para>
			</note>
			<itemizedlist>
				<title>Adding a bot</title>
				<listitem><para><guilabel>Bot name</guilabel>: This is the title of the bot that will be used on the forum. You will see it in the list of bots in the <acronym>ACP</acronym> and in the Who is Online lists.</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para><guilabel>Bot style</guilabel>: You can select the style served to the bot from the list of installed styles on the board.</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para><guilabel>Bot language</guilabel>: You can do the same with the language. The bot will use the language selected here.</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para><guilabel>Bot active</guilabel>: The bot session will be created only if a bot is active, if not, the data for a bot set in this form will not be used anywhere.</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para><guilabel>Agent match</guilabel>: You can match a bot by either its user-agent or its IP. You can specify a part of the user-agent to be looked for. For example, the Google search indexer has "Googlebot" in its user-agent, so you would enter it here to identify when Google crawls your board.</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para><guilabel>Bot IP address</guilabel>: This field is also used to identify the bot. If a bot cannot be recognized by the user-agent, you can specify what <glossterm>IP address</glossterm> should be used to identify it. Partial matches are allowed, that means you can include only the first two or three octets of the IP if the rest dynamically changes. You can also enter multiple IPs separated by a comma.</para></listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
			<note>
				<para>If you enter both a user-agent and an <glossterm>IP address</glossterm>, both have to match to identify the bot.</para>

			<title>Mass email</title>
			<para>phpBB allows you to send an e-mail or message to every user on the board, which allows it in his <link linkend="ucp_preferences">board preferences</link>. The message can serve as a newsletter, notification about changes on the board etc. You can choose whether to send the e-mail to all users, a specific group or a list of specific users. The e-mail is sent from the administrator's e-mail address and all recipients are included in a BCC - Blind Carbon Copy.</para>
			<para>On some hosts, sending a mass e-mail can be a problem, since sometimes the hosting company limits the number of e-mails that can be sent out at once. phpBB includes only 50 recipients per e-mail and sends another one for the next batch to prevent this, however, if you still are not able to send a mass e-mail, consult the situation with your hosting provider.</para>
			<itemizedlist>
				<title>Composing a mass e-mail</title>
				<listitem><para><guilabel>Send to group</guilabel>: Select the group you want to send the e-mail too. The Registered Users group contains all the users on the board.</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para><guilabel>Send to users</guilabel>: You can also specify a list of users. Entering any usernames in this field will override the first setting. Each username should be on a new line.</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para><guilabel>Subject</guilabel>: This is the subject of the message, which you are used to enter when sending an e-mail.</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para><guilabel>Your message</guilabel>: This field contains the message, you can only enter plaintext. <glossterm>BBCode</glossterm> or HTML will be encoded in HTML entities and shown as is without formatting the text when the user receives the e-mail.</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para><guilabel>Mail priority</guilabel>: This is the priority of the e-mail sent with the e-mail headers.</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para><guilabel>Mail banned users</guilabel>: By default, banned users will not receive mass e-mails. Check this box if you would like to include those users in the mail mailing.</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para><guilabel>Send immediately</guilabel>: You can choose whether to send the e-mail immediately or pass the messages to the cache system and let them be sent gradually.</para></listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
			<note>
				<para>Sending e-mails to all users on the board or a large group can be a lengthy process. Wait until the script confirms that the e-mails have been sent.</para>

Individual modules can be optionally disabled and it is possible to reorganize them into a different structure. Modules for the User Control Panel and the Moderator Control panel have a Category &#187; Module two-level structure, while the Administration modules have three levels: Category (tabs at the top) &#187; Category (headers on the left-hand side) &#187; Module (individual sections).</para>
			<para>Very often, extensions that have controllable features add modules to the ACP to allow comfortable editing of various settings.</para>
